# Classification-Seizure-Dataset

Final Project ECE 6254: Statistical Signal Processing at Georgia Institute of Technology

Worked on a four person team project to classify and predict seizure dataset. Compared three classifiers (linear SVM, radial SVM, and KNN) to classify low and high risk seizure dataset. Modified model to reduce bias towards the low risk seizure dataset. Obtained highest accuracy of 75% with PCA and R-SVM.
